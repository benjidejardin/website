            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    I am a PhD candidate in Economics specializing in labor economics. My research focuses on understanding 
                    labor market dynamics, wage inequality, and the impact of policy interventions on employment outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through rigorous empirical analysis and innovative methodological approaches, I aim to contribute to 
                    our understanding of how workers and firms interact in modern labor markets, with particular attention 
                    to questions of equity and efficiency.

                    <h3>Labor Market Dynamics and Wage Inequality</h3>
                    <p class="status">Status: In Progress</p>
                    <p>
                        This project examines the relationship between labor market concentration and wage dispersion. 
                        Using administrative data, I analyze how employer market power affects earnings across different 
                        skill levels and industries.

                    <p class="status">Status: Data Collection</p>
                    <p>
                        This study investigates the employment effects of minimum wage increases using quasi-experimental 
                        methods. I focus on heterogeneous effects across demographic groups and local labor market conditions.

                    <p class="status">Status: Early Stage</p>
                    <p>
                        This research explores how the shift to remote work has affected job mobility, wage growth, and 
                        geographic labor market integration. I use novel data to understand the long-term implications 
                        for workers and employers.
